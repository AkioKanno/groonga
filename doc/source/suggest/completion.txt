==========

This section describes about the following of the completion
feature:

  * How it works
  * How to learn

How it works
------------

The completion uses three searches to compute completed
words:

  1. Prefix RK search against registered words.
  2. Cooccurrence search against learned data.
  3. Optional prefix search against registered words.

Prefix RK search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RK means Romaji and Katakana. Prefix RK search can find
registered words by romaji, katakana or hiragana.

For example, there is a registered word "日本". "ニホン" (it
must be katakana) is registered as its reading. An user can
find "日本" by "ni", "二" or "に".
