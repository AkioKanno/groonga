Vector column
=============

Summary
-------

Vector column is a data store object. It can stores zero or more
scalar values. In short, scalar value is a single value such as number
and string. See :doc:`scalar` about scalar value details.

One of vector column use cases is tags store. You can use a vector
column to store tag values.

You can use vector column as index search target in the same way as
scalar column. You can set weight for each element. The element that
has one or more weight is matched, the record has more score rather
than no weight case. It is a vector column specific feature. Vector
column that can store weight is called weight vector column.

You can also do full text search against each text element. But search
score is too high when weight is used. You should use full text search
with weight carefully.

How to create a normal vector column
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use :doc:`/reference/commands/column_create` command to create a
normal vector column. The point is ``COLUMN_VECTOR`` flag:

.. groonga-command
.. include:: ../../example/reference/columns/vector/usage_create_normal_column.log
.. column_create Bookmarks tags COLUMN_VECTOR ShortText

You can set zero or more tags to a bookmark.

You can use a table as column type:
