groonga-httpd
=============

Summary
-------

groonga-httpd is a program to communicate with a groonga server using the HTTP
protocol. It functions as same as :ref:`groonga-server-http`. Although
:ref:`groonga-server-http` has limited support for HTTP with a minimal built-in
HTTP server, :ref:`groonga-httpd` has full support for HTTP with an embedded
nginx. All standards-compliance and features provided by nginx is also available in
groonga-httpd. For details about nginx, see http://www.nginx.org/

groonga-httpd has an Web-based administration tool implemented with HTML and
JavaScript. You can access to it from http://hostname:port/.

Synopsis
--------

::

 groonga-httpd [nginx options]

Usage
-----

Set up
^^^^^^

First, you'll need to edit the groonga-httpd configuration file to specify a
database. Edit /etc/groonga/httpd/groonga-httpd.conf to enable the
groonga_database directive like this::

   # Match this to the file owner of groonga database files if groonga-httpd is
   # run as root.
   #user groonga;
   ...
   http {
     ...
     # Don't change the location; currently only /d/ is supported.
     location /d/ {
       groonga on; # <= This means to turn on groonga-httpd.

       # Specify an actual database and enable this.
       groonga_database /var/lib/groonga/db/db;
     }
     ...
   }

Then, run groonga-httpd. Note that the control immediately returns back to the
console because groonga-httpd runs as a daemon process by default.::

   % groonga-httpd

Request queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To check, request a simple query (:ref:`command-status`).

.. groonga-command
.. database: groonga-httpd
.. include:: ../../example/reference/executables/groonga-httpd.log
.. /d/status

Browse the administration tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also, you can browse Web-based administration tool at http://localhost:10041/.

Shut down
^^^^^^^^^

Finally, to terminate the running groonga-httpd daemon, run this::

   % groonga-httpd -s stop

Configuration directives
------------------------

This section decribes only important directives. They are
groonga-httpd specific directives and performance related directives.

The following directives can be used in the groonga-httpd configuration file.
By default, it's located at /etc/groonga/httpd/groonga-httpd.conf.

Groonga-httpd specific directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following directives aren't provided by nginx. They are provided
by groonga-httpd to configure groonga-httpd specific configurations.

``groonga``
"""""""""""

Syntax::

  groonga on | off;

Default
  ``groonga off;``

Context
  location

Specifies whether groonga is enabled in the location block. The
default is ``off``. You need to specify ``on`` to enable groonga.

Examples::

  location /d/ {
    groonga on;  # Enables groonga under /d/... path
  }

  location /d/ {
    groonga off; # Disables groonga under /d/... path
  }

``groonga_database``
""""""""""""""""""""

Syntax::

  groonga_database /path/to/groonga/database;

Default
  ``groonga off;``

Context
  location

Specifies the path to a groonga database.

Performance related directives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following directives are related to the performance of groonga-httpd.

``worker_processes``
""""""""""""""""""""

For optimum performance, set this to be equal to the number of CPUs or cores. In
many cases, groonga queries may be CPU-intensive work, so to fully utilize
multi-CPU/core systems, it's essential to set this accordingly.

This isn't a groonga-httpd specific directive, but an nginx's one. For details,
see http://wiki.nginx.org/CoreModule#worker_processes.

By default, this is set to 1. It is nginx's default.

Available nginx modules
-----------------------

All standard HTTP modules except HttpRewriteModule is available.
HttpRewriteModule is disabled to avoid to depend on PCRE (Perl Compatible
Regular Expressions). For the list of other standard HTTP modules, see
http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules.
