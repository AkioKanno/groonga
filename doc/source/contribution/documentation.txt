How to contribute in documentation topics
=========================================

I18N
----

We only had documentation in Japanese.  We start to support
I18N documentation. We'll use English as base language and
translate English into other languages such as
Japanese. We'll put documentations into doc/source/ and
process them by Sphinx_.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

But we still use Japanese in doc/source/ for now. We need to
translate Japanese documentation in doc/source/ into
English. We welcome to you help us by translating
documentation.

C API
-----

We still have C API documentation in include/groonga.h. But
we want to move them into doc/source/c-api/. We welcome to
you help us by moving C API documentation.
