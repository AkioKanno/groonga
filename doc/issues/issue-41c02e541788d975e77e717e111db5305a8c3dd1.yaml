title: arrays with _value column behave as if _value column were _key column
desc: |-
  Arrays shouldn't have _key column, yet arrays with _value column violate this
  definition. This bug is introduced by naive implementation of traversing table
  records by its _key column, which is used in the sorting functionality. Ideally,
  the traversing code should behave differently depending on hash and patricia
  tables or array tables with value column. When the table is of such array type,
  it should explicitly use _value column as if it were the array table's
  non-existing _key column. In other words, it shouldn't relay on the lower layer
  silently returning _value column when requesting _key column.
